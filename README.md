countdown
=========
# Introduction
A really simple, inelegant countdown based on a quote from Ray Avery. 

It counts down in days, cognisant of the fact that the average humans has about 30'000 days in the bank.

This is hosted at http://tmault-days.bitballoon.com and is purposefully rough around the edges. 

## Getting Your Own Version Up and Running
* It uses UNIX time, so to get your own copy up and running, just change those details. 
* Grab the average human life expectancy for your country, and then run "[BIRTHDATE] + [YOUR COUNTRIES LIFE EXPECTANCY]" in Wolfram Alpha for a strange amount of detail about the rough day you should expect to pass away

Some think such a tool is macabre, but I find it useful for framing long-term decisions - this isn't the pakce to debate its merits or rough nature!

*Note!* This repository contains a few assets that are specific to deployment on my domain (e.g. my favicon).
